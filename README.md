# Online Drug Delivery System

This Git repository hosts the code and resources for our project, an online drug delivery system designed to provide a convenient and efficient way for users to order pharmaceutical products and have them delivered to their doorstep. The project was undertaken from September 2022 to March 2023 as a significant milestone during our engineering studies.


## Key Features

- **User Authentication:** Implemented a user authentication system to allow users to create accounts and securely log in.
- **Shopping Cart:** Developed an "Add to Cart" feature to enable users to select products and place orders.
- **Product Pages:** Designed and implemented dedicated product pages with comprehensive product information and pricing details.

## How We Did It

This project marked our introduction to web development, and we embraced self-learning to gain practical experience in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

As novice developers, we adopted an iterative approach, continually refining the user interface and functionalities based on feedback from our supervisor.

Despite the initial lack of project management experience, we learned to manage scope and objectives on the fly, gaining valuable insights into project management during the project's progression.

## Achievements

- Acquired a strong foundation in frontend development, becoming proficient in HTML, CSS, and JavaScriptâ€”a valuable asset for a frontend developer role.
- Honed our ability to create user-centric designs that enhance the user experience, fostering a passion for creating intuitive interfaces.
- Developed skills in managing project scope and objectives as the project evolved, highlighting the importance of adaptability and resourcefulness.
